    This PowerShell script retrieves all users from the "CANES Users" 
    organizational unit in Active Directory and checks their smart card 
    logon requirements. It identifies users who are not required to use 
    a smart card. The script is designed to export any users without 
    smart card requirements to a CSV file.
