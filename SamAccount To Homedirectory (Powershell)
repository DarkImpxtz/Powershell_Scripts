Should be run on DC01 with full permissions. 

#########################################################################

    This PowerShell script retrieves all users from Active Directory and 
    examines their home directory paths. It compares each user's 
    SamAccountName to their HomeDirectory to find any discrepancies 
    (i.e., if the paths do not match). The results of this comparison 
    are exported to a CSV file, showing which users have incorrect 
    home directory paths.

    There are two variable that must be defined within the script
    1. Line 30 = Searchbase
    2. Line 43 = CSV Location
