Should be run on the Exchange server under an account with full permissions to edit files.

    This PowerShell script looks for log files in a specified directory on 
    the Exchange server. It targets files with a .log extension and checks 
    for any that haven't been modified in the last 5 days. Once identified, 
    the script deletes those old log files. Ensure you have the right permissions 
    when running it to avoid any permission issues.

    NOTE:
        This can and should be automated with task scheduler

$find_log_files = Get-ChildItem -Path $path_to_logs -Include $file_types_to_include -Recurse

# Filter the found log files to locate those that were last modified more than 5 days ago
$find_date_modified = $find_log_files | Where { $_.LastWriteTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-5) }
