    This PowerShell script retrieves a list of all computers with names 
    matching "U-" from Active Directory. It uses the Get-ADComputer 
    command to gather the necessary information and then connects to 
    each computer using a PowerShell session. The script collects 
    BIOS details, including the manufacturer and serial number, and 
    appends this data to a CSV file for reporting purposes. Error handling 
    is implemented to ensure the script runs smoothly even if some 
    connections fail.
